# sam-app

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) command line interface (CLI). It includes the following files and folders:

- `src` - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- `events` - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- `__tests__` - Unit tests for the application code. 
- `template.yaml` - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

## Deploy the sample application

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

The API Gateway endpoint API will be displayed in the outputs when the deployment is complete.

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name sam-app
```
